"""Build the docs and print the tutorial to ``site/tutorial.pdf``.

The page is printed from the built site rather than from Markdown, so the PDF carries the
same rendering, screenshots and code blocks the site does. Chromium is driven through
Playwright, which is layered in at call time rather than locked into the project:

    uv run --with playwright playwright install chromium
    uv run --with playwright python scripts/docs_pdf.py

``--skip-build`` prints from a ``site/`` that is already built, which is what CI does after
its own ``mkdocs build``.
