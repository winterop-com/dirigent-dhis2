"""The block reference is kept by hand in this pack, so it is held to what the catalog publishes.

dirigent renders its own page from the installed catalog and fails the build when the file and
the catalog disagree. The pack has no renderer of its own -- ``dirigent-core`` is not a
dependency here -- so this is the half a pack can check without one: every field a block
publishes says what it is, and what it says is on the page in the spelling a table cell renders
it in. A field added to a block, or a docstring rewritten, therefore fails here rather than
drifting out of the page quietly.
